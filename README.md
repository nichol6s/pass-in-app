# Pass-in app 💜

Welcome to the Pass-in repository, an attendee credential management application! It allows event attendees to conveniently manage their credentials.
Attendees can generate a credential code, register for events, upload a photo, and use a QRCode for check-in. This project was developed during the NLW Unite event hosted by [@Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat).
